### The definition of statistics.
**Statistics** is the science of developing and studying methods for collecting data through surveys or experiments[<sup>1</sup>][cuemath], anaylzing it (especially for the purpose of inferring information about a whole from a smaller representative sample[<sup>2</sup>][oxford]) and representing the data for easy interpretation and further analysis.

The word **statistics** comes from the German *Statistik* (description of a state)[<sup>3</sup>][wikipedia1]; as the name implies, interest in statistics was initially driven by the governments' need for census data.
**Statistics** currently deals with turning large amounts of data available in many applied fields into useful information[<sup>4</sup>][britannica].

### What is a dataset? From the observation units to the dataset attributes and variables.
A **dataset** is collection of data maintained in an organized form[<sup>1</sup>][explorable].
In the case of tabular data, a **dataset** corresponds to one or more database tables, where every column represents a variable, and every row corresponds to a record[<sup>2</sup>][wikipedia2].

Statistical **datasets** may record as much information as is required by the experiment, therefore the researcher first needs to determine which **attributes** need to be acquired from the observation units[<sup>1</sup>][explorable].

An **attribute**, which could be *any* quality of the unit, is not directly representable in a computer system for analysis. For example, we cannot store the exact <u>height</u> or <u>age</u> of a person in a computer, as they are continuous values, or we cannot analyze <u>human health</u> without a way of measuring it.

For these reasons, **attributes** need to be operationalized, to create **variables**[<sup>3</sup>][wikipedia4]. Operationalizing means making a phenomenon directly measurable by defining a way to measure it (it may be a fuzzy definition) and by defining a *scale of measure*. For example, the height of a person could be represented with a categorical **variable** (*short*, *tall*), or human health can be operationalized by one or more **variables** like the <u>body mass index</u> or <u>tobacco smoking</u>[<sup>4</sup>][wikipedia4].

**Author's Notes**:
It is possible that, in different contexts, these words mean completely different things. It is not uncommon on the Internet to find sources defining attributes and variables as qualitative and quantitative values, or constant or variable values.

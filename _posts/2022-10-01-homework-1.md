### The definition of statistics.
**Statistics** is the science of developing and studying methods for collecting data through surveys or experiments[<sup>1</sup>][cuemath], anaylzing it (especially for the purpose of inferring information about a whole from a smaller representative sample[<sup>2</sup>][oxford]) and representing the data for easy interpretation and further analysis.

The word **statistics** comes from the German *Statistik* (description of a state)[<sup>3</sup>][wikipedia]; as the name implies, interest in statistics was driven by the governments' need for census data.
Statistics currently deals with turning large amounts of data available in many applied fields into useful information [<sup>4</sup>][britannica].

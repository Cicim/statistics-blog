### The definition of statistics.
**Statistics** is the science of developing and studying methods for collecting data through surveys or experiments[<sup>1</sup>][cuemath], analyzing it (especially for the purpose of inferring information about a whole from a smaller representative sample[<sup>2</sup>][oxford]) and representing the data for easy interpretation and further analysis.

The word **statistics** comes from the German *Statistik* (description of a state)[<sup>3</sup>][wikipedia1]; as the name implies, interest in statistics was initially driven by the governments' need for census data.
**Statistics** currently deals with turning large amounts of data available in many applied fields into useful information[<sup>4</sup>][britannica].

### What is a dataset? From the observation units to the dataset attributes and variables.
A **dataset** is collection of data maintained in an organized form[<sup>1</sup>][explorable].
In the case of tabular data, a **dataset** corresponds to one or more database tables, where every column represents a variable, and every row corresponds to a record[<sup>2</sup>][wikipedia2].

Statistical **datasets** may record as much information as is required by the experiment, therefore the researcher first needs to determine which **attributes** need to be acquired from the observation units[<sup>1</sup>][explorable].

An **attribute**, which could be *any* quality of the unit, is not directly representable in a computer system for analysis. For example, we cannot store the exact <u>height</u> or <u>age</u> of a person in a computer, as they are continuous values, or we cannot analyze <u>human health</u> without a way of measuring it.

For these reasons, **attributes** need to be operationalized, to create **variables**[<sup>3</sup>][wikipedia4]. Operationalizing means making a phenomenon directly measurable by defining a way to measure it (it may be a fuzzy definition) and by defining a *scale of measure*. For example, the height of a person could be represented with a categorical **variable** (*short*, *tall*), or human health can be operationalized by one or more **variables** like the <u>body mass index</u> or <u>tobacco smoking</u>[<sup>4</sup>][wikipedia4].

**Author's Notes**:
It is possible that, in different contexts, these words mean completely different things. It is not uncommon on the Internet to find sources defining attributes and variables as qualitative and quantitative values, or constant or variable values.  

### Find interesting applications of statistics to cybersecurity problems.
Here are what problems in cybersecurity statistics can help with:

1. Statistical methods can be used to analyze large data sets to identify trends and patterns.

    **Ex**: this paper studies which factors affect risky cybersecurity behaviors:
    [Factors affecting risky cybersecurity behaviors by U.S. workers: An exploratory study -- Andrew R. Gillam, W. Tad Foster][paper-1]

2. Statistical analysis can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of security measures.

3. Statistical methods can be used to assess the risk of cyber attacks to help organizations to prioritize their security efforts. 

    **Ex**: this paper studies a risk-management model for cyber attacks: [Cyber Risk Management for Critical Infrastructure: A Risk Analysis Model and Three Case Studies -- Elisabeth Pat√©-Cornell, Marshall Kuypers, Matthew Smith, Philip Keller][paper-3].

4. Statistical analysis can be used to develop models to predict future cyber attacks. 

    **Ex**: this paper shows a method for predicting when cyberattacks will happen: [Predicting Cyber Attack Rates With Extreme Values -- Zhenxin Zhan, Maochao Xu, Shouhuai Xu][paper-4].

5. Statistical methods can be used to evaluate the impact of cyberattacks.

    **Ex.**: this report uses statistic methods to assess and present the global impact of cyber attacks: [The Economic Impact of Cyber-Attacks -- Brian Cashell, William D. Jackson, Mark Jickling, and Baird Webel][paper-5]

# (A) Application
### Create simple applications in C# and VB.net to play with event handlers understanding the syntactical differences between the two languages
The application consists of three simple code samples:
1. Adds text to the text area when double-clicking on it

    ![Example 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/hw1/Example1.gif)

    **C# code**
    ```c#
    private void TextArea_DoubleClick(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        if (SampleIndex != 1)
            return;

        // Prepend a counter to the text of the area
        String newString = DateTime.Now.ToString();
        TextArea.Text = newString + "\r\n" + TextArea.Text;
    }
    ```

    **VB.net code** (there is no syntax highlighter for VB.net)
    ```vbnet
    Private Sub TextArea_DoubleClick(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
        If SampleIndex <> 1 Then Return

        ' Prepend a counter to the text of the area
        Dim newString As String = Date.Now.ToString()
        TextArea.Text = newString & vbCrLf & TextArea.Text
    End Sub
    ```
2. Changes the text area's color while moving the mouse over it
    ![Example 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/hw1/Example2.gif)

    **C# code**
    ```c#
    private void TextArea_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
    {
        if (SampleIndex != 2)
            return;

        // Get the position within the textarea
        // relative to the size of the textarea
        // as an integer between 0 and 255
        int x = (e.X * 256) / TextArea.Width;
        int y = (e.Y * 256) / TextArea.Height;

        // Convert them to a color
        int r = x;
        int g = y/2 + 32;
        int b = y;

        TextArea.BackColor = Color.FromArgb(r, g, b);
        TextArea.ForeColor = Color.FromArgb(255 - r, 255 - g, 255 - b);
        TextArea.Text = "(" + r + ", " + g + ", " + b + ")";
    }
    ```

    **VB.net**
    ``` vbnet
    Private Sub TextArea_MouseMove(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As MouseEventArgs)
        If SampleIndex <> 2 Then Return

        ' Get the position within the textarea
        ' relative to the size of the textarea
        ' as an integer between 0 and 255
        Dim x As Integer = e.X * 256 / TextArea.Width
        Dim y As Integer = e.Y * 256 / TextArea.Height

        ' Convert them to a color
        Dim r = x
        Dim g As Integer = y / 2 + 32
        Dim b = y

        TextArea.BackColor = Color.FromArgb(r, g, b)
        TextArea.ForeColor = Color.FromArgb(255 - r, 255 - g, 255 - b)
        TextArea.Text = "(" & r & ", " & g & ", " & b & ")"
    End Sub
    ```

3. Counts the number of words in the text area and shows it on a progress bar

    ![Example 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/hw1/Example3.gif)

    **C# code**
    ```c#
    private void TextArea_KeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
    {
        if (SampleIndex != 3)
            return;

        // Compute the word count
        String text = this.TextArea.Text;
        int count = Regex.Matches(text, @"[\S]+").Count;

        if (count < WordProgressBar.Minimum)
            count = WordProgressBar.Minimum;
        else if (count > WordProgressBar.Maximum)
            count = WordProgressBar.Maximum;

        WordProgressBar.Value = count;
        ProgramForm.ActiveForm.Text = count.ToString();
    }
    ```

    **VB.net code**
    ```vbnet
    Private Sub TextArea_KeyUp(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As KeyEventArgs)
        If SampleIndex <> 3 Then Return

        ' Compute the word count
        Dim text As String = Me.TextArea.Text
        Dim count As Integer = Regex.Matches(text, "[\S]+").Count

        If count < WordProgressBar.Minimum Then
            count = WordProgressBar.Minimum
        ElseIf count > WordProgressBar.Maximum Then
            count = WordProgressBar.Maximum
        End If

        WordProgressBar.Value = count
        Form1.ActiveForm.Text = count.ToString()
    End Sub
    ```


# (TA) Research on Application
### Main differences between C# and VB.net

The main differences between **C#** and **VB.net** are the following:
+ **VB.net** was created for the express purpose of creating applications for Visual Studio, so it has more syntactic sugar and better constructs to make writing form applications easier. These features, like the `Handles` keyword have less intuitive counterparts in **C#**, like the event handler appending with `+=`.
+ **VB.net** was created to be more beginner-friendly. It has some syntax which, although easier to understand, can be too verbose for experienced programmers. For instance, variable declaration written as `Dim name As Type = value` is much longer than the **C#** equivalent `type name = value;`.
+ **VB.net** is *case-insensitive* (uppercase and lowercase variants of a letter are considered as the same), while **C#** is *case-sensitive*.
+ **C#** requires semicolon at the end of each statement, while **VB.net** only requires each statement to be on a different line.
+ **VB.net** has specific keywords (`begin`, `end`) to delimit code blocks, while **C#** uses the more C-like curly brackets.
+ **VB.net** has the `My` namespace for class elements, while **C#**, like other object-oriented programming languages uses `this`. 
+ **VB.net** automatically coerces values from a type to another on assignment, which may be very unsafe and produce undefined behavior. **C#** does not allow it.

There is a detailed [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_C_Sharp_and_Visual_Basic_.NET) describing all the differences between the two languages.

### Illustrate the concept of joint, marginal and conditional relative frequency using a simple bivariate distribution.

Let us use the following table, depicting the bivariate distribution of eye color and hair color:
|Absolute<br>frequencies|blue|brown|green|
|-|--|--|--|
|black  |3|4|1|
|blonde |4|2|3|
|red    |1|2|0|
|brown  |2|6|2|

By dividing each cell by the total, we get the joint distribution of the two variables: each cell now represents the probability of observing an individual with both that eye color and hair color.
|Joint<br>distribution|blue|brown|green|
|-|--| --|--|
|black  |10.00%|13.33%| 3.33%
|blonde |13.33%| 6.66%|10.00%
|red    | 3.33%| 6.66%| 0.00%
|brown  | 6.66%|   20%| 6.66%

Now, by restricting our table on a row or column, and renormalizing the resulting distribution, we can extrapolate the conditional distribution relative to a value of a variable.

|Conditional<br>distribution|green|
|-|--|
|black  |16.66%
|blonde |50.00%
|red    | 0.00%
|brown  |33.33%

*This is the original distribution conditioned on the people with green eyes*.

From the joint distribution, we can also compute the marginal distributions, by summing up the relative frequencies on each row/column and renormalizing.

||blue|brown|green|HairColor
|-|--|--|--|--|
|black   |10.00%|13.33%| 3.33%|26.66%
|blonde  |13.33%| 6.66%|10.00%|30.00%
|red     | 3.33%| 6.66%| 0.00%|10.00%
|brown   | 6.66%|   20%| 6.66%|33.33%
|**EyeColor**|33.33%|46.66%|20.00%

### Explain all possible derivations of the arithmetic mean and in general the other common types of averages
The **arithmetic mean**, reports the central tendency amongst a set of numbers by using their sum. It is usually weighted with equal weights for each values, but the weights can be changed.

$$A_W(\{a_n\}_{n=1}^N, \{w_n\}_{n=1}^N)=\sum_{n=1}^N a_n\cdot w_n,\quad \sum_{i=1}^N w_n=1$$

Here is the most famous version:

$$A(\{a_n\}_{n=1}^N)=A_W(\{a_n\}_{n=1}^N, \{w_n=\dfrac1N\}_{n=1}^N)=\dfrac1N \sum_{n=1}^N a_n$$

The sum of all the numbers in the set is equal to the sum of an equal amount of copies of the arithmetic mean.


Central tendencies don't have to be found with sums, like the arithmetic mean, but they can also be found with **products**, resulting in the **geometric mean**:

$$G(\{a_n\}_{n=1}^N)=\Big(\prod_{i=1}^N a_n\Big)^{\frac 1N}$$

The geometric mean can also be seen as the arithmetic mean in logarithmic scale:

$$G(\{a_n\}_{n=1}^N)=\exp\Big(\frac 1N \sum_{i=1}^N \log(a_n)\Big)$$

The product of all numbers in the set is equal to the product of an equal amount of copies of the geometric mean.

Another generalization for the mean is the **power mean**:

$$M_p(\{a_n\}_{n=1}^N)=\Big(\frac 1N \sum_{n=1}^N a_n^p \Big)^{\frac 1p}$$

This formula allows us to define the previously-seen means and infinitely many others:

|$$M_p$$|Symbol|Name|
|---|---|---|
$$M_{-\infty}$$| $$\min$$|    minimum
$$M_{-1}$$|     $$H$$|      harmonic mean
$$M_0$$|        $$G$$|      geometric mean
$$M_1$$|        $$A$$|      arithmetic mean
$$M_2$$|        $$\text{RMS}$$|    root-mean-square
$$M_\infty$$|    $$\max$$|    maximum

### Illustrate the difference between "mathematical convergence" and "convergence" in probability
When we talk about convergence of a sequence in mathematics, we are talking about point-wise convergence.

Given a sequence $$\{a_n\}_{i=1}^N$$, we say it converges to the point $$\ell$$ if $$\forall\varepsilon \exists n_0$$ such that:

$$|a_n-\ell|\le \varepsilon\quad \forall n>n_0$$

We then say that $$\ell$$ is the **limit** of $$a_n$$ as $$n$$ goes to infinity, or

Meanwhile, when we refer about converge in probability, we are referring to convergence of a set of random variables $$X_1,X_2,\dots,X_N$$ to a **distribution** $$X$$. This, as opposed to point-wise convergence, is a function-wise convergence.

It means that $$\forall\lambda\forall\varepsilon\exists n_0$$ such that

$$\mathbb P(|X-X_n|\le \lambda)\le\varepsilon\quad\forall n>n_0$$

Which is actually derived from the following relationship:

$$\forall\lambda,\quad\lim_{n\to\infty}\mathbb P(|X-X_n|\le\lambda)=0$$

### Illustrate the differences between Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics and the role of probability and probability distributions





# (A) Application
### Given an arbitrary rectangle and a distribution, create the corresponding histogram or column chart, with both vertical and horizontal orientation


### Given a rectangle, enable its movement/resize/zoom using a mouse (this will be the resizable where we will draw alll future charts)
